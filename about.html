                   Service to the cow - saving it, nurturing it and protecting its calf - has the effect of transferring this positive frequency to an individual which may then be used for negating imbalances in the body, environment or for upliftment of the soul. On the other hand, killing or harming this being, consuming its meat, has the opposite effect - breeding disease, and paving the way for lower painful births. All religions and cultures of the world, and even modern medicine accepts, that cow beef spells disease in a human.Human society should learn how to give protection specifically to the cows.Then the protection of religious principles, fulfillment of the aim of life and protection of Vedic knowledge can be achieved
